# d2912r0: Concurrent queues and sender/receivers

This paper explores extending an interface of Buffered Queue (https://wg21.link/p1958r0) with async APIs
conforming to Sender/Receiver model according to https://wg21.link/p2300. It also makes stylistic API
changes to be more consistent with existent library facilities.

Additionally, we report on implementation experience (https://github/GorNishanov/conqueue)
addressing the concern that supporting
both synchronous and asynchronous push/pop in the same queue is a challenge (https://wg21.link/p2882r0).
The answer based on the implementation is that it is no challenge at all.

## Changes to buffer_queue

By following an example of `std::future`, enum `queue_op_status` was renamed to `conqueue_errc` and we
introduced an exception `conqueue_error` that will be thrown to carry the `conqueue_errc`.

```c++
enum class conqueue_errc { success = 0, empty, full, closed };
class conqueue_error : runtime_exception { ... };
... make_error_code, make_error_condition, conqueue_category, ...
```

The member functions `wait_pop` and `wait_push` were used as non-throwing versions of a blocking `pop` and `push`. By analogy with how
`<filesystem>` deals with this case, we restyled them as follows:

```c++
T pop(); // used to be pop_value
std::optional<T> pop(std::error_code &ec); // used to be wait_pop
std::optional<T> try_pop(std::error_code &ec);
```

```c++
void push(const T& x);
bool push(const T& x, error_code &ec); // used to be wait_push
bool try_push(const T& x, error_code &ec);

void push(T&& x);
bool push(T&& x, error_code &ec); // used to be wait_push
bool try_push(T&& x, error_code &ec);
```

Finally, to support async push and pop, we added

```c++
sender auto async_push(T x) noexcept(is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T>);
sender auto async_pop() noexcept;
```

Note that async versions do not have `const T&` and `T&&` flavors,
since the handling ot the value may occur later on a different thread
the move of the value is required.

Based on usage experience, we can consider adding asynchronous equivalents of
other flavors of push and pop.

## Implementation experience

A demonstration implementation is available in https://github/GorNishanov/conqueue.

An implementation only requires some kind of
critical section that being able to
change several related values atomically.
For example, spin lock is sufficient.

Additionally, to implement blocking for
synchronous push and pop, it is sufficient to use
C++20's `std::atomic_flag` wait facilities.

The highlights of one possible implementation are:

```c++
class buffer_queue {
  ...
private:
  std::mutex mutex; // or spin lock of some sort
  detail::ring_buffer buffer;
  // If the queue is empty, waiters are the readers.
  // If the queue is full, waiters are the writers.
  detail::intrusive_queue<&waiter_base::next> waiters;
  bool closed{};
};
```

Common base for both synchronous and asynchronous waiters stores:

```c++
struct waiter_base {
  waiter_base* next{};
  // For push case, we store the pointer to the value to be pushed.
  // For pop case, we store the value poped from the queue.
  variant<monostate, conqueue_errc, T, T*> value;
  void (*complete)(waiter_base*) noexcept;
};
```

And a concrete implementation for a synchronous waiter:

```c++
template <typename T> struct buffer_queue<T>::blocking_waiter : waiter_base {
  std::atomic_flag flag;

  blocking_waiter() noexcept {
    this->complete = [](waiter_base *w) noexcept {
      auto *self = static_cast<blocking_waiter *>(w);
      // Notifying sync waiter.
      self->flag.test_and_set();
      self->flag.notify_one();
    };
  }

  blocking_waiter(T &x) noexcept : blocking_waiter() {
    this->value = std::addressof(x);
  }

  void wait() noexcept { flag.wait(false); }
};
```

Sender/receiver implementation is a bit more involved (as usual with sender/receivers unrelated to the task at hand), so
here we are only showing the completion routine:

```c++
this->complete = [](waiter_base* w) noexcept {
  auto* self = static_cast<operation*>(w);
  if (auto* errc = get_if<conqueue_errc>(&self->value))
    stdexec::set_error((Receiver&&)self->receiver,
                        make_exception_ptr(conqueue_error(*errc)));
  else
    stdexec::set_value((Receiver&&)self->receiver);
};
```

Processing of the waiters is performed unifromly by interacting with waiter_base by
setting or reading error or value from the variant and invoking `complete` to resume the
sender or synchornous waiter. Having the queue support both synchronous and asynchronous APIs does not present a challenge.

## T pop() vs void pop(T&)

In the original paper [buffer_queue paper](https://wg21.link/p1958r0), the pop function
had signature `T pop_value()`. Subsequently, it was changed to `void pop(T&)` due to
concern about the problem of loosing elements.

Unlike STL's combinations of `void pop()` and `T& front()` that are possible for synchronous cases, such a solution does not work for concurrent queues, where we
cannot observe the value before popping it from the queue.

Comparing `T pop()` and `void pop(T&)` we believe that they are equivalent from
exception safety standpoint and `T pop()` wins on ergonomics of usage.

Naming wise, we chose `T pop()` rather than `T pop_value()` for consistency with the rest
of the APIs and due to `[[noexcept]]` guarding against misuse (thus if a user imagined that pop API is `void pop()` by analogy with `std::stack`, for example, a compiler error
will quickly bring them to their senses.

## try_push(T&&) vs try_push(T&&, T&)

The paper [p0260r5](https://wg21.link/p0260r5) suggest that for non-blocking `try_push`
API, the signature should be: `queue_op_status try_push(T&&, T&)` with the rule:

> If the queue is full or closed, return the respective status and move the element into the second parameter. Otherwise, push the element onto the queue and return `queue_op_status::success`.

We believe that it is unnecessary to have two arguments `T&&` and `T&`, it is sufficient to have just one, `T&&`. If, for implementation reasons, the value was moved out of the parameter and it was discovered that the push is not possible, the value could be moved
back to the parameter.
