# d2912r0: Concurrent queues and sender/receivers

This paper explores extending an interface of Buffered Queue (https://wg21.link/p1958r0) with async APIs
conforming to Sender/Receiver model according to https://wg21.link/p2300. It also mades stylistic API
changes to be more consistent with existent library facilities.

Additionally, we report on implementation experience (https://github/GorNishanov/conqueue)
addressing the concern that supporting
both synchronous and asynchronous push/pop in the same queue is a challenge (https://wg21.link/p2882r0).
The answer based on the implementation is that is no challenge at all.
